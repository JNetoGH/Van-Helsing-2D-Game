## GAME OVERVIEW

It summarizes the entire game concept, target audience, targeted platforms and  technicalities like game engine.

**Concept:**
This is a platformer action game based on the movie "Van Helsing (2004)", focused on methodical combat and pattern learning boss fights. It will have a fluid combat system with responsive controls with some elements drawn from the ***Soulslike***, ***Shoot 'em Up*** and  ***Run and Gun*** genres.
Being a direct inspiration from the movie "Van Helsing (2004)", it features a dark and gothic art style and features vampire related enemies and locations. We will control a demon hunter, armed with a repeating crossbow and portable saws, with the task of defeating Dracula and any other related beings.
The player will play as Van Helsing revisiting scenarios and battles taken straight from the movie.

**Target Audience:**
The action based combat and dark fantasy / victorian themes and its harsh difficulty make this game more appealing to a mature audience, specifically adolescents and young adults.

**Target Platform:**
The target platform this project will be idealized will be Desktop Windows but due to the accessibility of the controls and the mechanics we are intending on implementing, there will always be a possibility that we might make console versions.

**Unique Selling Points:**
* Boss Fights 
* Side Scroller 
* Platforms
* Variety Combat/Movement Mechanics and Playstyles 
* Experiencing first hand iconic battles from the Van Helsing Movie



## GAMEPLAY

Includes things like the objectives, game progressions, and overall style of the game (RPG, First-Person Shooter, Third-Person).

**Objectives/Progression:**
The game  is highly inspired in other games like Cuphead, Dead Cells and Mega Man, where there progression is mostly linear. 
The player is meant to complete a esier part of the level first, with "easier" and more "generic" enemies, in other to reach a boss in the end of the level to a more unique and hard boss fight.
Being inspired by the ***Soulslike*** sub-genre, the player is meant to repeat the levels many times in order to get progressively better while learning the bosses and commum enemies patterns.

**Gameplay Style:**
The Gameplay style is inspired in the ***Shoot 'em Up*** and the ***Run and Gun*** genres, where the player is meant to try quickly complete the phase, rushing on the enemies shooting projectiles. 
This game is also meant to have some melee combat, they are dangerous strikes but also make a higher damage.



## LEVELS
For now we have only  2 levels planned, more can be added in the future, the movie has many combat scenes.

**First Level:**
It's inspired in the battle of Van Helsing against the three Dracula's brides, Verona, Aleera and Marishka, as in the movie it played in the village next to Frankenstein's castle, the player will play through the viallage until he encounters the brides, then a triple boss battle begins.

**Second Level:**
This level is based on the last battle of the movie where Van Helsing faces Dracula at his castle, it's a vertical level just like in the movie, this fight is placed on a tower.

## USER INTERFACE (UI) 

**Style:**
The games follows a medieval victorian dark style so the Game User Interface will also be designed in this aesthetic, we want to maximize the information the player can have at their disposal without cluttering the screen and interfering with gameplay.
For this reason we firstly intend to move most of the information of the Game User Interface information to the bottom side of the player’s screen as some levels have a vertical scrolling direction.
A clean GUI helps the player focus on gameplay, although we won’t discard the beauty factor when creating these.
